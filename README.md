# Web of Czech PHP Community

We're family of PHP developers from the Czech Republic, we love to learn from each other through meetups and trainings.
We meet once in a month in the city of Prague,Brno and less often 4 other cities.
We are here to help each other in learning new concepts and implementing it.
